# TFT-Set4-EDA

## Introduction

Over the past five months, I have been very obsessed with the game, 'Teamfight Tactics' (or for short, TFT). TFT is an 'autochess' based game where you compete against seven other players to build a board of units to defeat every other player. 

## EDA

### Primary Statistics

### Analysis based on week

### Analysis based on Account

### Analysis based on starting item

### Analysis based on final chosen unit/trait

## Future Directions

There are a handful of things that can be done to progress this EDA in the future, namely relating to the data categorisation and data collection aspect.

When it comes to data collection, there could be some way to use the Riot Games API to collect a list of all the teams I have used (and maybe the teams my opponents used) in each game. That way, I can then determine which units I perform well with and against (and vice versa). A couple of analytic tools already accomplish such a feat already, such as tactics.tools, which allow me to analyse my performance on the last 20, 50, and 100 games. 

In addition, I wish to potentially replicate this EDA using SQL in order to develop my SQL toolbox. Hopefully, by learning SQL, I will also figure out new findings I can get from the same dataset.
